            <p>Advocacy is taking action to help people say what they want, secure their rights, 
                represent their interests and obtain services they need. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Advocates and advocacy providers work in partnership with the people they support 
                and take their side. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Advocacy promotes social inclusion, equality and social justice.
