        Please consider the evidence outlined in this document and fulfil the appropriate duty to provide:<br/>

        <ol>
            <li><b>A Care Act Assessment</b><br/>
                S.9 (1) Care Act 2014<br/>
                <i>http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/23/section/9/enacted</i>

            </li>
        </ol>

        Please note the advocacy duty applies from the first point of contact with the local authority + any subsequent stage of the assessment, planning, care review ect.<br/><br/>

        The local authority must arrange an Independent Care Act Advocate to facilitate the involvement of a person in their assessment, in the preparation of their care and support plan and in the review of their care plan in two conditions are met:<br/>
        <ol>
            <li>That if an independent advocate were not provided the person would have substantial difficulty in being fully involved in the process.</li>
            <li>There is no appropriate individual available to support and represent the personâ€™s wishes who is not paid or professionally engaged in providing care or treatment to the person or their carer.</li>
        </ol>

        Please feel free to contact the client or The Advocacy Project if more information is required.<br/><br/>
            
        Warm Regards,<br/><br/>
